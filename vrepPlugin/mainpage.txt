/*! \mainpage VREP Integrated paparazzi simulation (VIPSIM?)
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This vrep-plugin provides a framework for integrating
 * the native paparazzi control-loop for UAVs into the 3D virtual-
 * robot experimentation platform v-rep, created for the simulation
 * of the quadricopters in the Otto-Von-Guericke University swarm-
 * lab.<br>
 * It works by feeding the paparazzi flight dynamics model data obtained from 
 * the 3D simulation environment provided by vrep, and then exectuing the commands
 * paparazzi provides based on that data.
 *  
 * \section install_sec Installation and usage
  
 \subsection step1 Step 1: Repositories and vrep
Install vrep and paparazzi. <br>
Clone https://github.com/ovgu-FINken/Simulation/tree/paparazziSimSingle for the vrep code(branch paparazziSimSingle) <br>
and https://github.com/ovgu-FINken/paparazzi (branch vrepSimOrig).


 \subsection step2 Step 2: Dependencies and libraries
Install boost and eigen3.
Make sure to add the variables PAPARAZZI_HOME and VREP_HOME to you environment variables,
pointing to the respective root folders.

 \subsection step2 Step 3: Running the simulation
To run the simulation, open vrep and load the scene finkenRotated.ccc provided in the simulation repository.
If you wish to build your own scene, make sure to include the "scriptloader" object in as in the example scene
or the plugin will not work.<br>
In paparazzi, select the aircraft "test" and build the target nps.

Then press play on the vrep simulation, followed by executing the paparazzi simulation.
